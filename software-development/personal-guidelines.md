# Personal guidelines

These are personal guidelines about sofware development and engineering.

## Use consistent standards to format you code

## Write readable/simple code, for humans, not for machine

## Never put naming aside

## Follow the principle of Least Surprise

## Follow SOLID principle (especially for OOP)

## Always be humble

## Don't try to solve problems you don't have. Everything comes at the right time

A Monolith is often fine if it's [modular](https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first). For instance:
- In 2023, Amazon Prime Video team migrated one system from Microservices to a Monolith and reduced cliud costs by 90%.
- In 2020, Uber teams migrated many of their microservices to macroservices (well-sized services).

## Code slowly following the guidelines will save you time in the long run
